## 📘 What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?  

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that combines all major components of a computer system—CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnect—onto a single chip.It offers **high performance, reduced power consumption, compact design, and cost efficiency** compared to multi-chip systems.

## 🧩 Components of a Typical SoC  
1. **CPU (Processor Core):** Executes program instructions and performs computation.  
2. **Memory (SRAM, DRAM, Flash):** Stores instructions, data, and intermediate results.  
3. **Peripherals (UART, SPI, I²C, GPIO, Timers):** Enable communication with external devices.  
4. **Interconnect (Bus/Fabric):** Provides a communication backbone between CPU, memory, and peripherals (e.g., AMBA AHB/AXI).
