<div align="center"> 📘 Week2 — BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling (VSD)</div>

## 📌 Overview  
This folder contains my completed work for **Week2** of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.  
It covers two major tasks:  

1. [Task 1 - Theory: SoC Fundamentals & BabySoC Modelling](./Task%201%20-%20SoC%20Fundamentals%20and%20BabySoC%20Modelling.md)  
2. [Task 2 - Labs: BabySoC Functional Modelling using Icarus Verilog & GTKWave](./Task%202%20-%20BabySoC%20Functional%20Modelling.md)

## ✅ Completed Tasks  

### 📝 Task 1: SoC Fundamentals & BabySoC Modelling  
- Understood the basics of **System-on-Chip (SoC)** and its components:  
  - CPU (Processor Core)  
  - Memory (SRAM, DRAM, Flash)  
  - Peripherals (UART, SPI, I²C, GPIO)  
  - Interconnect (Bus/Fabric)  
- Learned why **BabySoC** is used as a **simplified model** for SoC education.  
- Explored the role of **functional modelling** in validating SoC design before RTL and physical implementation.  
- 📄 Document: [Task 1 - SoC Fundamentals & BabySoC Modelling](./Task%201%20-%20SoC%20Fundamentals%20and%20BabySoC%20Modelling.md)

### 🛠️ Task 2: BabySoC Functional Modelling (Hands-On Labs)  
- Installed and used:  
  - 📟 **Icarus Verilog (Iverilog)** – for compiling Verilog code  
  - 📊 **GTKWave** – for analyzing simulation waveforms  
- **Lab workflow followed:**  
  1. Cloned the BabySoC repository  
  2. Compiled BabySoC Verilog modules using `iverilog`  
  3. Simulated and generated `.vcd` files  
  4. Opened `.vcd` in GTKWave  
  5. Analyzed reset, clock, and dataflow waveforms  
- **Simulation Logs & Observations:**  
  - Reset correctly initializes the system  
  - Clock toggling verified at 10ns period  
  - Dataflow between CPU and memory (write & read) confirmed functional  
- 📄 Document: [Task 2 - BabySoC Functional Modelling](./Task%202%20-%20BabySoC%20Functional%20Modelling.md)

## ✨ Status  
All Week2 activities are **successfully completed and documented**.  
The outcome includes both **theoretical understanding of SoC fundamentals** and **practical demonstration of BabySoC functional modelling with simulation waveforms**.
