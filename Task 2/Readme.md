<div align="center"> <h1>🛠️ Task 2 – Practical BabySoC Functional Modelling </h1></div>

## 📌 Overview  
This task focuses on the **practical side of BabySoC design** through functional modelling.  
Using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and **GTKWave**, I compiled and simulated BabySoC modules to analyze their behavior.  
The goal was to validate **reset, clocking, and dataflow** operations before moving into RTL and physical design stages.
